grbm:  The LAT data is below the high-energy slope (beta).  The rest of the model looks good.  GOOD.

sbpl:  Same as GRBM.  GOOD.

copl:  bad â€” high energy data has nothing to match it.

grbm+lpow:  The power-law component is possible insignificant.  It only contributes at low energies.  It's more significant than the PL in the sbpl+lpow.  

sbpl+lpow:  The power-law component isn't significant and errors could not be obtained.  It kept trying to search in other areas, even at 1-sigma level. Continue error search in this direction?

copl+lpow:  Data and model don't match very well at high energies.  The LLE data is above the PL and the LAT data is below it.  This may indicate that the LLE and LAT data are not calibrated well.  No offsets were used in this analysis.



copl+blackb:  Not a good fit. Nothing to support high-energy data.

sbpl+blackb+lpow:  no 2 sigma errors possible.
